4. Unique Feature - Friends
As a mandatory unqiue feature, I added a the functionality of friends. I added a table "friends" into the database, which consists of two columns with the IDs of the befriended users. At the server itself, I added a list of Guids, which stores the IDs of the befriended users. 

	4.1 Add Friends	
	The first feature is the posibility to add friends. To add a user as a friend, 
	send the request POST /friends with the username of the friend as a payload, 
	the IDs of the users will be added to the database and to the Guid lists.

	4.2 Show List of Friends
	With the request GET /friends, the server returns a list of the data, 
	either json or plain format, of all your friends. 
	The data contains the ID, username, alternative name, bio, image, 
	coins, the stats and also the IDs of their friends.

	4.3 Battle Friends
	Users can join specific battles with the request POST /battles/\{username\}. 
	This only works if the user, which started the battle, 
	is befriended with the joining user.

	4.4 Remove Friends
	With the request DELETE /friends/ and the username as the payload, 
	the users will no longer be befriended. The relationship in the database and 
	also the IDs in the coresponding lists will be deleted.
